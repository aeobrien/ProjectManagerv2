# 7. Vision Discovery (Partially Built, Not Wired Up)

There's infrastructure for a `.visionDiscovery` conversation type with exchange-aware prompts and a `READY_FOR_VISION` signal convention. It's designed for imported projects that already have a structure but need a vision statement generated through conversation. The prompts exist, the ContextAssembler handles it, but **no UI entry point exists** — it's dead code from a planned but not-yet-implemented flow.
