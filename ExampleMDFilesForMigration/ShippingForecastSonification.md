# ShippingForecastSonification

## Version History
- v0.1 - 14 Jun 2025 - Migrated to structured format
## Core Concept
A generative sound installation that transforms the daily UK Shipping Forecast into a 12-hour evolving musical composition. Each maritime region becomes a distinct musical movement shaped by real-time geographic, meteorological, and oceanographic data, offering both an artistic and semi-documentary portrayal of the British Isles’ surrounding seas.

## Guiding Principles & Intentions
- Celebrate the poetic and cultural significance of the UK Shipping Forecast
    
- Create a daily-evolving sonic environment that reflects real maritime conditions
    
- Merge field recordings, data sonification, and ambient composition practices
    
- Provide both a meditative and educational experience
    
- Honour regional identities through musical and vocal choices
## Key Features & Functionality
- **Data Integration**: Live forecast parsing (wind, visibility, sea state, pressure)
    
- **Geographic Mapping**: Music shaped by each area’s proximity to land and culture
    
- **Generative Composition Engine**: Builds ambient pieces with regional musical phrases
    
- **Field Recordings**: Maritime and coastal sounds for realism and atmosphere
    
- **Voice Integration**: Authentic readings of forecast excerpts in regional accents
    
- **Perspective Generator**: Listener “vantage point” system (e.g. lighthouse, trawler)
    
- **Transition System**: Smooth or dramatic transitions based on forecast change
    
- **12-Hour Cycle**: Installation resets daily with a new unique composition
## Architecture & Structure
- **Input**: Parsed shipping forecast + static geographical metadata
    
- **Parameter Mapping Engine**: Translates input into sonic parameters (tempo, tone, intensity, texture)
    
- **Composition Generator**: Builds audio using modular layers
    
    - Ambient beds
        
    - Percussive/rhythmic patterns
        
    - Regional instrumental phrases
        
    - Voice & field recordings
        
- **Output**: Multi-channel audio system with optional visual feedback
## Implementation Roadmap
### Phase 1: Research & Framework Design

- Map shipping areas and define geographic/cultural traits
    
- Design parameter mapping system
    
- Determine data sources and parsing logic
    
- Define listener perspective profiles
    

### Phase 2: Content Creation

- Record field audio (coastlines, vessels, weather)
    
- Compose modular regional phrases
    
- Collect/record voice samples in regional accents
    

### Phase 3: Engine Development

- Build generative composition engine
    
- Implement parameter weighting/interdependency system
    
- Develop transition logic between areas
    

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement

- Run historic forecast tests
    
- Adjust mappings based on musical quality and coherence
    
- Optimise for long-duration playback
    

### Phase 5: Installation Build

- Design physical installation environment
    
- Integrate multi-channel speaker system
    
- Optional: Add visual projection system
## Current Status & Progress

## Next Steps
- [ ] Approach composer
- [ ] Create list of potential modulation styles
- [ ] Determine direct data to parameter mapping
- [ ] Find previous data scraping system test
## Challenges & Solutions
- **Complex parameter interdependencies**  
    → Weighted mapping system with prioritised modifiers
    
- **Avoiding repetition in 12-hour playback**  
    → Use large library with randomisation and subtle transformations
    
- **Technical instability over long playback**  
    → Test with looped data, implement robust memory management
    
- **Balancing realism and abstraction**  
    → Blend literal (field/voice) and interpretive (music) elements in shifting ratios
## User/Audience Experience
- Ambient, immersive listening environment
    
- Continuous sonic evolution reflecting current maritime conditions
    
- Optional visualisation of area transitions and weather highlights
    
- Educational materials available on-site or online
## Success Metrics
- Ability to run daily without manual input
    
- Clear sonic differentiation between regions and weather states
    
- Positive audience engagement and dwell time
    
- Press or institutional interest in installation longevity or touring
## Research & References
- UK Met Office Shipping Forecast protocol
    
- Music Information Retrieval / Data Sonification techniques
    
- Field recording practices (Chris Watson, Jana Winderen)
    
- Regional folk instruments and scales
    
- Acoustic ecology and soundscape design
## Open Questions & Considerations
- How to manage licensing if voice snippets are derived from official forecasts?
    
- Could this become an online stream in parallel to physical installation?
    
- What balance of abstraction vs. literal sound best serves repeat engagement?
    
- Is there a role for visual accessibility or real-time subtitles/translations?
