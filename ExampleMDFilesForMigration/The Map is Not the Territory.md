## Current Status & Progress
- An initial version containing 50 scores was printed and distributed among friends.
- The project is now expanded to include about 100 scores.
- Preliminary steps towards self-publishing and design improvement are under consideration.
## Next Steps
- [ ] Research picture research and image licensing costs.
- [ ] Assess different self-publishing models and their associated costs.
- [ ] Collaborate with a designer to improve the book's design.
